The morning bruks, the shndows flee3
PureunivermlloveThonart!

To me, to an, Thy bowels move3

Τῐιγ nature md Τὴγ name is love.

My prayer hath powerwith God: the grace
Unspakable 1 now πάνυ

Through saith 1 see Thee face to face,
Isee Thee face to face, and live.

In vain 1 have not wept and strove3

Thy nature and Thy name is love.

Ι know Thoe, Savium, who Thou art :
Jews, the feehle sinuer’s friend 1

Nor wilt Thou with the night depart,
But stay, and love me to the end.

Thy mercies never shall remove,

Thy nature and ΤΙιγ name is love.

The Sun of Righteousness on me
Hath rose, with heuling in His wings;
Withered my nature’s strength, from Thee
My soul its life and succour brings.
My help is au laid up above 3
Thy nature and Τῐιγ name is love.

Contented now, upon my thigh
I halt, tin life’s short jonrney end ;
