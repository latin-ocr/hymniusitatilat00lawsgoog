‘ He thatfollowetb Me shall not wast in aarum!

LEAD, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead Thou me on 3

The qight is (ιω, and 1 am far {mm home}
Lead Thou me ους

KeepThou my feet; Ido not asktosee

Τὴε distant scene3 one step enough for me.

1 was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Should’st lead me 01¹3

1 loved to cboose and see my path3 but now
Lead Thou me on Ι

I loved the gatish day, and, spite of fars,

Ptide ruled my will ε remember not past years.

So long Thy power bath blest me, sure it still
will lead me on
O’er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone,
And with the mom those angel-sac& smsse,
Which 1 have loved long since, and lost awhile.
-J . Η. Newman.
