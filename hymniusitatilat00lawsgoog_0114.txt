HYMNI USITATI

An helplessness, all wenkness, 1

On Thoe alone for strength depend;
Nor have 1 power from 'rhee to move ;
Thy nature and Thy name is love.

Lame as 1 am, Ι take the prey,
Hell, earth, and sin with ease o’ercome3
Ι leap for joy, pursue my way,
And as a bounding hart fly home,
Thtough 211 eternity to prove,
Thy nature and Thy name is love.
—Charles Wesley.
