Ι.
‘ Tbey brought anto Him also infants.'

IN token that thou shalt not sear
Christ crucified to own,

We print the cross upon thy brow,
And mark thee His alone3

In token that thou shalt not blush ,
To glory in His Name,

We blazon here upon thy from
His glory and His shame;

In token that thou shalt not flineh
Christ's confliet to maintain,

But ’nath His banner mansully
Firm at thy post remain ;

In token that thou too shalt tread
The path He travelled by;

Endure the crosS, daepise the shame,
And sit with Him on high3

Thus outwatdly and visibly
We seal thee for His own3
And may the brow that wears His Cross

Hereafter share His crown!
