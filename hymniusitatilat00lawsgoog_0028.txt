HYMNI USITATI

11.

‘ maudo thou kumtnot noto, but thou shall
know hereaflcr!

GOD moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform ;
He planta His footsteps in the sen,
And rides upon the storm.

Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-faiIing skill,

He treasuroe up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.

Ye fearful saints, fresh contage take-‚3
The clouds ye so much dread

Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your had.

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace:

Behind a frowning providence
He h'ides a smiling face.

His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hom· ;

The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.
