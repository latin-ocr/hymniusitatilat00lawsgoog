‘ Until that day when Ι drink it new with you in my
Fatber’s kinqdom!

HERE, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face 3

Here saith can touch and handle things unseen;

Here would I grasp with firmet hand Thy grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.

Here would 1 seed upon the bread of God;

Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heaven ;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load3

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.

1 have no help but Thine3 nor do 1 need
Another arm save Thine to lean upon;
It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed ;
My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.

Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness3

Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood ε
Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace-

Thy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord, my God.

Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
The feast, though not the love, is past and gone3
The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here
Nearer than ever-still my Shield and Sun.
