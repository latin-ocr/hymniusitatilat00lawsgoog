HYMNJ (18er TI

IX.

‘ The world pass-eth away, and the lust thereos!

A FEW more years shall roll,
A few more seesons come,

Andweshallbewiththosethatroet
Asleep within the tomb ;
Then, Ο my Lord‚ prepare
My soul for that great day ;

O wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.

A few more suns shall set
O’er these dark hius of time,
And we shall be where suns are not-
A far serenet clime 3
Then, Ο my Lord, prepare
My soul for that bleet day3
O wash me in Thy precious Blood‚
And take my sins away.

A few more storms shall beat
On this wild rocky shore,

And we shall be where tempests ceam,
And surges swell no more:
Then, Ο my Lord‚ prepare
My soul for that calm day ;

Ο wash me in Τὴγ precious Blood‚
And take my sins away.
