HYMNI USITA TI

‘ That Rock was christ:

ROCK of AgeS, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
elea-nse me from its gunt and power.

Not the labours of my hands

Can fulfil Thy law's demands ;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flmv,

All for sin could not atone,

Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring, “
Simply to Thy Cross Ι cling3

‚ Naked, come to Thee for dress ;

HelpIess, look to Thee for grace 3
Foul, 1 to the fountain fly3
Wash me, Savioun or Ι die!

While 1 draw this fleeting breath,

When my eyelids close in death,

When 1 soar through tracts unknown,

See Thee on Thy judgment throne,

Rock of Ages‚ dest for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee Ι
-Toplady.
