‘Abide with us, sor it is totvards ιυιπὶηρ, and the day
is far spent?

ABIDE with me 1 fast falls the eventide3

The darkness deepensl Lord‚ with me abide3
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpleeS, O abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth’s joys grew dim, its glories pass away3
Chmgeanddecayinallatoundlsee3

O Thou who changoet not, abide with me.

1 need Thy presence every passing hom-3

What but Thy grace can soil the tempter’s power?
Who like ‘rhyself my guide and stay can be ?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

1 sear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;

111⁸ have no weight, and tears no bitterness ;
Where is death's sting ἲ where, grave, thy victory P
Ι triumph still if Thou abide with me.

Hold Thou Thy Crosa before my closing eyes,
Shine through the glemu, and point me to the skies;
Haven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows
flee3
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
