‘Restm antonne tbaejoyofTbysalwtion, and
upbold me with Thyfree spirit?

OH 1 for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heavenly framel
A light to shine upon the road
That leeds me to the Lambl

Where is the bleesedness 1 knew
When first 1 saw the Lord?

Where is the seul-refroehing view
Of Jesus and His Word ?

What peaceful hours Ι once enjoyed Ι
How sweet their memory still!

But they have left an aehing void
The world can never fill.

Rerum, O holy Dovel return,
Sweet mezenger of rest 1

1 hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
And drove Thee from my breast.

The dem-est idol 1 have known,
Whate’er that idol be,

Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.
