FOLIA CAD UCA. 121

XXXIII.

TRANSLATION.

THAT voice is immed, the tuneful tangue is still,
Whoee music oft thrilled through this hallowed
fane,
That hand now eald, whose touch, with healing
skin,
Wasprompttosoothethesuffeoer’sbedofpain.
Mid squalid homes, Death claimed thee for his prey,
Helping the helplm, thou thy life hast given 3
One place is vacant in ont midst to-day3
Our voicoe salter, thine is hen-d in Heaven.
Yes, we believe, Physicim‚ Mimtrel, FrIend,
'those tona are heard amid th’ angeli: fflrong,
That voice and form, remembered to the end,
Too soon deputed, live in praise and song,
And mains, which here below our δοιὼ have riven,
Now swell the glorium symphonias of Heaven.
