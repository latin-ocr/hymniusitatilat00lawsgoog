‘ They brmcybt unta Hem au that were diseased!

THINE arm, O Lord, in days of old
Was strong to heal and save3

It triumphed o'er disease and death,
O’er darkness and the εἴπω

To Thee they went, the blind, the dumb,
The palsied, and the lame,

The leper with his tainted life,

. The sick with feveted frame.

And 10 1 Thy touch brought life and health,
Gave speech and strength and sight3

And youth renewed and frenzy calmed
owned Thee, the Lord of Light3

And now, O Leni, be near to mess,
Almighty as of yore,

In crowded street, by reetless coueh,
As by Gennesareth’s shore.

Be Thou our great Deliveret still,
Thou Lord of life and death 3
Rectore and quicken, soothe and bless

with Thiae almighty brea-1123
