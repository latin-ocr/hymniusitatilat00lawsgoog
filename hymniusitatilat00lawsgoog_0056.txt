34 avum usn-A rt

A few more strugglae here,
A few more pfflngs o’er,

A few more toils, a few more τεαῖς,
And we shall weep no more 3
Then, Ο my Lord, prepare
My soul for that bright day;

Ο wash me in ny precinas Blood,
And take my sins away.

’Tis but a little while,
And He will come again
Who died that we might live3 who lim
That we with Him may reign3
Thea, Ο my Lord, prepm
My soul for that glad day3
Ο wasb me in Thy precious ΒῙοοᾱ,
And take my sins away.
