HYMNI USITATI

VI.
‘Is not this the SonofMary?’

WHEN our heads are bowed with wne,
When out bitter tears o’erflow,
When we mourn the lost, the dear,
Gracions Son of Mary, hear.

Thou our throbbing flesh hast worn ;
Thou our morta] griefs hast bome3
Thou hast shed the human tear3
Gracious Son of Mary, hear.

When the solemn death-bell tells,
For our own departing souls3

When our final doom is near,
Gracious Son of Mary, hear,

Thon hast bowed the dying head ;
Thon the blood of life hast shed3
Thou hast filled a mortal bier;
Gracious Son of Mary, hear.

When the beart is sad within

With the thought of all its sin ;

When the spirit shrinks with sear,
Gracious Son of Mary, hear.
