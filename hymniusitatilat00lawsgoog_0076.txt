54 H YM NI USITA TI

XVI.

‘ There is none other Name where'by ωε must he saved. '

HEN wounded sore the stricken soul
Lies bleeding and unbound‚
One only Hand, a pierced Hand,
Can salve the sinuer's wound.

When sorrow swells the laden breast,
And tears of anguish flow,

One only Heart, a broken Heart,
Can feel the sinner’s woe.

When penitence has wept in vain
Over some foul dark spot,

One only stream, a stream of blood,
Can wash away the blot.

’Tis Jesus’ Blood that washes white,
His Hand that brings relief3
‚ His Heart is touched with all our joys„
And feeleth for our grief.

Lift up Thy bleeding Hand, O Lord,
Unseal that cleansing tide ;
We have no shelter from our sin
But in Thy wounded side.
—Frances Cecil Alexander.
