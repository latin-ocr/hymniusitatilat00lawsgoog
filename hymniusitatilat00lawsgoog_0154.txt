On Rnnmc m soum ιτ “ R. C. D.‚’'
mmm “Iu Mamm, G. P. C.”

YESI meum the soul, of high and pure intent,
Humane as valiant, in disastrous fight.

Laid low on far Majuba’s bloody height!

Yet, not his death alone must we laneat,

But more, such spirit on evil mission sent,

To back om· broken saith with armed might ;

And, the unanswered plea of wounded right

Struck (lumb by warfare’s brute arbitrament‘.

And while thece deeds are done in England’s name,

Religion, unregardful‚ keeps her cell;

The tuneful note that wails the dead, we heau

Where are the sacred thunders that should swell

To shame such foul oppression, and proclaim

Eternal justice in the nation's ear?

J. R. 1.
