‘ They «mercam by ibe blood of the Lamb?

THE Son of God goes forth to war,
A kingly crown to gain3

His blood-red banner streams afar;
Who follow& in His train ἶ

Who best can drink His cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain ;

Who patient bears His Cross below,
He follows in His train.

The martyr, first, whose engle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave;

Who saw his Master in the sky,
And called on Him to save.

Like Him, with pardon on his tongne,
ln midst of mortal pain,

He prayed for them that did the wrong z
who follows in his train?

A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came 3

Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew
And mocked the crosa and flame3

They met the tyrant’s bmndished steel,
The lion's gory mane3

They bowed their necks the death to feel ε
Who follows in their train ἲ
