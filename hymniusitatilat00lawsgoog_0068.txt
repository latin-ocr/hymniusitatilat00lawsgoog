HYMNI USITA TI

XIV.

‘ There shall be a fhuntain opened for sin
andfor uncleannessss

THERE is a fountain filled with blood,
Drawn from Emmanuel's veins,
And sinuers plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thies reioiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there have 1, as vile as he,
Washed all my sins away.

E'et since, by saith, 1 saw the stream
ΤΙιγ flowing wounds supply,

Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till 1 die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
1’11 sing ΤΙιγ power to save,

When this poor, lisping‚ stammering tongue
Liae silent in the grave.

Lord, 1 believe Thou hast prepared,
Unworthy though 1 be,
For me a blood-bought free reward,

A golden harp for me.
