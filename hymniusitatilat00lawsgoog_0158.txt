THE PIRATE‘S SONG.

O’ER the glad waters of the ἀει-Κ blue sea,

Out thoughts ns howellus, and our souls as free,
Far as the brem can bear, the billows fdam,
Survey oui empire, and behold our home Ι
These are our malms, no limits to their may,
Ourflagthe sceptre allwho meetobeyss
Oursthewildlifeinmmultstmtonnge
From toil to metanti joy in every change.
012, who can tell ἲ not thou, luxurious slave!
whose soal would sicken 0'er the heaving vave ;
Nor thou, vain lord of wantonnoes and ense 1

Whom slumbet soothoe not-pleasure cannot please ;
011, who can tell, save he whose hart hus tried!
And danced in ‘triumph o’et the waoets wide,

The exulting sense—the pulse’s maddening play
That thrills the wanderet of that trackless way,
That for itself can woo the approaching fight,

And turn what some <leem danger to delight!

That seeks what cruens alum with more than zeal,
And where the feebler faint-can only feel—

Feel, ω the rising bosom’s inmoet edre,

Its hope awtken, and its spirit soar.

No dread of death-if with ns die om· fooe,

Save that it seems even duller than repose.
