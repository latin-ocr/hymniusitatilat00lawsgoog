xxxv.
‘In ue is mne bap:

Ι LAY my sins on Jews,
The spotless Lamb of God,
He bears them an, and ftees us
From the accursed load.
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
To wash my crimson stains
White in His blood most prociona,
Till not a spot remains.

1 lay my νηοῖο on Iesum
All fuluas dwells in Him;
He heah all my dimon
He doth my seul oedoem.
1 lay my grief on Iesus»,
My burdens and my cares 3
He from them all releases‚
He all my sorrows shares.

1 rest my soul on Jesus,
This weary soul of mine ;
His right hand me embraces;
1 on His breast recline.
1 love the name of Jesus,
Emmanuel, Christ the Lord3
Like fragrance on the breezes,

· His name abroad is poured.
