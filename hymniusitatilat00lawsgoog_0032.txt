On which the Prince of glory died,

My richoet gain 1 count but lost,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that 1 should boast,
Save in the Croes of Christ, my G0d;

An the vain things that chann me most,
1 sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,

Or thoma compost so rich a crown Ρ

Were the whole ralm of Nature mine,
That we1e an offering fat too smalh
Leve so amazing, so divine,
Demands my hart, my life, my all.
