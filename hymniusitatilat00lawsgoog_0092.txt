HYMNI USITATI

xx1.
⁴ Ie is I, be not opaea:

HY those fears ἲ behold, ’tis Jesus
Holds the belm, and guides the ship:
Spread the stila, and catch the breezee
Sent to waft us through the deep,
To the regions
Where the monmers cease to weep.

'though the shore we hope to land on
Only by report is known,
Yet we freely all abandon,
Led by that report alone ;
And with Jesus
Thmugh the tracklees deep move ους

Led by that, we brave the ocean3 ’
Led by that, the storm defy3
Calm amidst tumultuous motion,
Knowing that our Lord is night
Waves obey Him,
And the storms before Him fly.

Rendered safe by His protection,
We shall pass the watery wasteg
Trusting to His wisc direction,
We shall gain the port at lasti
And with wonder,
Think on toils and daungers past.
