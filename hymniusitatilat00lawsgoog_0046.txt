24 HYMNI USITATI

vn.
‘ Son, be ofqood cbeer5 thy sins beforyiven thee!

EARY of earth, and laden with my sin,
1 look at heaven, and long to enter in;

But there no evil thing may find a home,
And yet 1 hear a voice that bids me ‘ Come.’

So vile 1 am, how dare 1 hope to stand

In the pure glory of that holy land Ρ

Before the whiteness of that throne appear Ρ

Yet there are hands stretched out to draw me near.

The while 1 fain would tread the heavenly way,
Evil is ever with me day by day,

Yet on mine ears the graeious tidings fan,

‘ Repent‚ confess, thou shalt be loosed from all!

Itis the voice of Jesus that 1 heu,

His ate the hands stretched out to draw me near,
And His the blood that ean for all atone,

And set me faultless there before the throne.

’Twas He who found me on the deathly wi1d‚
And made me heir of heaven, the Father’s child,
And day by day, whereby my soul may live,
Gives me His grace of pardon, and will give.
