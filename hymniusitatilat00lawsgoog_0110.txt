HYMNI USITATI

Wraeth‘ng, 1 will not let Thee go,
Tin 1 Thy name, Thy nature know.

'Tis all in vain to hold Thy tangue,
Or touch the hollow of my thigh ;

Though every sinew be unstrung,
Out of my arms Thou shalt not fly 1

Wrestling, 1 will not let Thee go,

Tin 1 ny name, ΤΙιγ nature know.

What though my shrinking flesh complain,
And murmur to contend so long?
1 rise superior to my pain3
When Ι am weak, then Ι am strong:
And when my all of strength shall fail,
1 shall with the God·Man prevail.

My strength is gone! my nature dies 1
Ι sink beneath Thy weighty hand,
Faint to revive, and fan to rise3
Ι fall, and yet by saith 1 stand!
1 stand, and will not let Thee go,
Till Ι Thy name, Thy nature know.

Yield to me now, for 1 am weak,
Yet confident in sels-despair!

Speak to my heart, in blessings speak,
Be conquered by my instant prayer;
Speak, or Thou never hence shalt move,

And tell me if Thy name is love?
