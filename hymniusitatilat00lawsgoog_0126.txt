104 H ΥΜΝΙ USITATI

XXIX.

‘Jacob went on bis way, and the angels qf God met βίω]

NEARER, my God, to Tbee,
Nearer to Theel

E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me:

still all my song shall be,

Neuter, my God, to Thee‚
Neuter to Theel

Though, like the wanderer‚
The sun gone down,

Darkness comes over me,
My rest a stone:

Yet in my dreams I’d be

Neuter, my God, to Thoe,
Nearer to Thee Ι

There let my way appear
Steps unto heaven3
Au that Thou sendoet me
In mercy given:
Angels to becken me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,'
Nearer to Theel
