HYMNI USITATI

XVIII.
‘ There were shepherds abidiny in the field!

IT came upon the midnight elear—
That glorious song of old,

From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold τ

‘ Peace on the earth, goodwill ‘to men
‘ From heaven's all-gracious King 1 '

The world in solemn stillness lay
To henr the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled ;

And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world :

Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on heavenly wing‚

And ever o'er its &bel-sounds
The blessed angels sing.

Yet with the woes of sin and strife
ΤΙιε world has suffered long ;

Beneath the angel-strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong ;

And men, at war with men, hear not
The words of peace they bring :—

Oh 1 listen now, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing 1
