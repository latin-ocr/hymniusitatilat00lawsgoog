The Lora Himself shall descmd from heaven with a
shut, with the voice qf the Archangel, aad with
the tmmp qf God.’

GREAT God, whatdo 1 see and hear?
The end of things created!
The Judge of mankind doth appear
On clouds of glory seeted 1
The trumpet munds, the graves restore
The dead which they contained before!
Prepare, my soal, to meet Him.

‘rhe dead in Christ shall first ariae
At the last trumpet's sounding,
Caught up to meet Him in the skiee,

With joy their Lord sumunding!
No glootny fenrs their souis dismay ;
His presence sheds etemal day

On those prepared to meet Him.

But sinnas, filled with guilty feam,
Behold His wrath prevailingl

For they shall fise, and find their tears
And sighs are unavailingl

The day ofgmce is passed and gone!

Trembling they stand before the throne
Au unprepared to meet Him.
