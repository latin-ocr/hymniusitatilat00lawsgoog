‘ The Lord God is a sun and a sbield!

SUN of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be neat ;

Oh Ι may no earth-born cloud arise

To hide Thoe from Thy servant's eyes.

When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,

Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour's breast.

Abide with me from mom till eve,
For without Thee Ι cannot live Ι
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die Ι

If some poor wand'ring child of Thine
Have spumed to-day the voice divine,

Now, Lord, the gracious work begin,

Let him no more lie down in sin.

Watch by the siclt, enrich the poor
With blessings from le boundless stote ;
Be every monmer's sleep to-night,

Like infants' slumbers‚ pure and light.
