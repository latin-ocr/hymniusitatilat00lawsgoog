HOW aeldom, Friendl the great good man inherits
Honourandvmlth withanhisworthandpainsl

It soumis like stol-ies from the world of spiriu,

If any man obtain that which he merim,

Or any merit that which he obuius.

For shame,dear Friendl renouncethiscantingmin3

Whatwonldstthou havethegmtgoodmmobnin?

wealth, title, salnay, a gilded chain,

Or throne of corpses which his swerd luth slain?

Greatnoes and goodness are not means, but ends;

Hath he not always treantes», always friends,

The great good man? three Μαῖα, love and light,

And calm thoughts reg-uhu· as infants’ brath,

And three fast friends, more sure than day and night,

Himself, his Maka, and the angel Denth.
