106 Ι ΗΥΜΝΙ UstrATJ

Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy puisse,

Out of my stony griefs
Bethel 1’11 raise3

So by my woes to be

Neuter, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Theel

Or if on joyful wing
Claeving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards 1 fly,
still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee1
-S. F. Adam.
