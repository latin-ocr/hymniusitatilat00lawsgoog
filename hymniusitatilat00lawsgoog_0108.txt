⁴ There wrestled a man with him until the breakinq
⁰f the day!

COME, 0 Thou Tmeller unknown,
whomstinlhold,butcanuotsee;
My company before is gone,
And 1 am left alone with Theel
With Tbee all night 1 mean to stay,
And wrestle tin the break of day.

1 noed not tell Thee who 1 am,
My misery or sin declam
Thyself hast called me by my name,
Look on Τὴγ hande, and read it there.
But who, 1 ask Thee, who art Thou?
Tell me Τὶιγ name, and tell ine now.

In vain Thon strugglest to get free,
1 never will unloose my hold3
Art Thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of Tiay love unfold:
Wrestling, 1 will not let Thee go
Till 1 Thy name, ny nature know.

wilt Thou not yet to me reveal
Tiay new, unutterable name ἶ

Tell me, 1 still beseech Thee, tell!
To know it now, molved 1 ως
