XXVIII.
‘ cm auto Me, allye that are uveam?

ART thou vary, art thou lang-uid,
Art thou sore distroet?
‘ Come to Me,' saith One, ‘ and coming,
‘ Be at roet!

Hath He marks to lead me ω Him,

1f He be my guido?
‘ In His feet and hands are wound·print8‚

‘ And His side?

Is there crown of royal splendent,
'l'hat His brow adorus ?
‘ Yon, a cmwn, in very surety‚
⁴ But of thorus?

1f 1 find Him, if 1 follow,
What my portion here?
‘ Many a sorrow, many a labent,
‘ Many a tear?

If 1 still hold closely to Him,

What heth He at last?
‘ Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,

‘Jordan past?
