XXII.
‘ Not my will, but Thiae be done?

MY G'od and Father, while 1 stray
Far from my home, in life’s rough way,

Ο, teach me from my heart to say,
‘Thywillbe done!’

Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me be still, and murmur not,
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
⁸ Thy will be done! ’

What though in lonely grief 1 sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh ἲ

Submissive still would 1 reply,
‘ Thy wilrbe done Ι ’

If Thou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prize—it ne’er was mine:
l only yield Thee what is Thine:
⁸ Thy will be done 1’

If but my fainting hem-t be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit forits guest,
My God, to Th‹=e 1 leave the ταῖς
‘ Thy will be done 1 ’
