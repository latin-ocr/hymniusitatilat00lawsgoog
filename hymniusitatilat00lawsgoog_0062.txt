‘ Then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud

with great power and glory.'

LO Ι He comes 1 with clouds descending‚
Once for favoured sinners slain3

Thonsand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train3
Hallelujah 1
God appears on earth to reign.

Every eye shall now behold Him
Robed in dreadful majestyl
Those who set at nought and sold Him,
piel-ced, and nailed Him to the trec,
Deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.

Now redemption, long expected,
See in solemn pomp appear!
All His saints, by man rejected,
Now shall meet Him in the air,
Hanelujah 1
See the day of God appear Ι

Yea‚ Amen! let all adore Τὴεε,
High on Thine eternal throne!
Saviour‚ take the power and glory;
Claim the kingdom for Thine own,
Ο come quickly,
Hallelujahl come, Lord, come.

—C . Wesley.
