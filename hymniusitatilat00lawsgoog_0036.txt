ΗΥΜΝΙ USITATI

Just and Holy is Thy Name,

1 am all unrighteousnoes3

False and full ofsin 1 am,
Thoumfulloftruthandgnce.

Plenteons grace with Thoe is found,
Gracc to cover all my sin ς
Let the haling streams abeund,
Make and keep me pute within ε
Thou of life the Fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee ;
Spring Thou up within my hart,
Rise to all eternity.

—C. Wesley.
