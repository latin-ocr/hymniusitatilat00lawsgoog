SIR GEORGE COLLEY AND THE BOER WAR.
Iu Μεκοιιᾼκ, G. P. C.

and breve, well skilled in that dread lore
Which mightiest nations dare not to unlearn3
Fair lot for thee had leapt from Fortune’s urn;
Just guerdon of long toil; and more and more
We counted for het favourite was in store;
Not failing in fond fancy to doecry
Victorinus wreath and crowus of victory
Which in our thought thy brows already wore,
But He who portions out our good and ill
Wined an austerer glory should be thine,
And nearer to the Crossthanto theCrown;
Then lay, ye monmers, there your burden down,
And hear culm voices stom the inner shrine
Which whisper, Pence3 and say, Be still, be still.
R. C. D.
