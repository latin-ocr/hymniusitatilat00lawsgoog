PREFACE.

THE early translations contained in this

collection, from No. 1. to XII., were
written two years since, and printed in
Dublin, for private circulatim, by my young
friend, Mr. Francis Ball.

Some of rny friends were good enough to
express their approval of them, as at least
conveying the spirit and meaning of the
originals3 and Ι have therefore been in-
duced to publish thern, with others which 1

have since written.
Ι have added some original verses, sacred
and secular, some of which owe their exist-

ence to the leisure which Ι was permitted
