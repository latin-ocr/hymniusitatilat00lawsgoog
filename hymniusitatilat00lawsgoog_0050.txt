HYMNI USITATI

VIII.

‘ The Loed, thy God, brinaetb thoe into
a qood land!

THERE is a land of pure delight,
Where saints immortal reign,
Infinite day excludes the night,
And ple-,sures banish pain ;

Tbere everlasting spring abides,

And never-withering flowers;
Death, like a nari-ow sea, divides

That heavenly land from ours.

Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
Stand dress'd in living green ;

So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.

But timorous mortals start and shrink
To crosa this narrow sea,

And linger shivering on the brink,
And sear to launch away.

Oh Ι could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy doubts that rise,

And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes 1
