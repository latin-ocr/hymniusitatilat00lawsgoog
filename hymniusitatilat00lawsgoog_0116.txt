‘There isjoy in tbeprmoeoftbe anguls ofGod over
one sinner {bat repantetbss

HARK, ank, my anuli angelis: ’nugs are swelling
O’er earth's green fields and ocun’s wave-beat
shore 3
How sweet the truth those hle-sed mains ate telling
Osthat new life when sin shall be no mure.
Angels of Jesus,
Angels of light,
Singing to welcome
The pilgrims of the night.

Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
Come, woery sou13, for Jesus bids you come3
And through the durh, its echoes sweetly ringing,

The music of the Gospel leads us home.

Angels of Jesus, διε.

Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing‚
The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and ειη
And laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,
Kind Shepherd‚ turn their παι-γ steps to Thoe.

Angels of Joeus„ διε.
