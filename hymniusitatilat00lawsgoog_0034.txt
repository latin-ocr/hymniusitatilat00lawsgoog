JESUS, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,

While the uenter waters roll,
While the tempoet still is high3
Hide me, Ο my Saviourl hide,
Tin the storm of life is μεὶς
Safe into the haven guide,

0 receive my soul et lust!

Other refuge have 1 none,

Hangs my helpless soul on Thee3
Luve, ahl leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me:
All my trust on Theee is stayed,
All my help from Thee Ι bring;
Cover my defenceless had ⁵
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thon, 0 Christ, artallI want3
Morethanall inTheeI find3
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Henl the sick, and lead the blind ;
